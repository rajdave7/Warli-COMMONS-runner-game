        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to the Warli Runner Game! In this game, you play as a member
          of the Warli community, running through their beautiful landscapes
          filled with natural resources such as trees, ponds, and mountains. As
          you encounter these resources, you'll witness how the Warli people
          respect and utilize them as shared resources, not commodities for
          profit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout your journey, you'll also encounter fellow community
          members. After reaching certain milestones and encountering natural
          resources, the community members will come together to perform the
          Tarpa dance around a fire, symbolizing the values of brotherhood and
          co-dependence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game aims to spread awareness about the concept of "Commons" and
          how the Warli community views nature and natural resources as shared
          assets for societal benefit and survival. By immersing yourself in the
          Warli culture and their harmonious relationship with nature, you'll
          gain a deeper appreciation for the importance of preserving our
          environment.
